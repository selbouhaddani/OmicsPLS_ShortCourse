# Introduction and description of the data

These are exercises for the OmicsPLS short course. There are several questions throughout the text, and the corresponding R code to answer the question is given after the question. The answer key contains all output of each code block as well as brief answers to the questions. Note that some questions don't have a unique answer, but the idea should be clear. 

## Load packages and datasets

We need several packages for data handling, fitting and visualizing the results. 

```{r Load packages}
library(tidyverse) # dataset & viz tools
library(magrittr)  # pipe operator
library(MASS)      # statistical tools, such as lda
library(parallel)  # parallel computing
library(plotly)    # interactive plots

library(OmicsPLS)  # data integration toolkit
```

The datasets are found in the `DownSyndrome.RData` file. A simple `load` statement should load them in your workspace. The `str` function can be used to get a first impression of the data objects. 

```{r Load and inspect datasets}
load("DownSyndrome.RData")  
## str gives an overview of all kinds of objects
cat("Methylation data:\n")
str(methylation)
cat("\nGlycomics data:\n")
str(glycomics)
cat("\nCpG grouping data per gene:\n")
str(CpG_groups)
```

## Descriptive analysis

Before any analysis can be performed, you should consider calculating some descriptives about the data. 

:::: {.bluebox .question data-latex=""}
**_Exercises._** Plot boxplots of (a subset of) the data columns. Also describe the clinical variables in terms of number of cases and controls, age and sex distributions. Are there any remarkable observations?

The variables appear to be symmetric, without large outliers. There are some large variance CpG variables. There are 29 DS patients, 29 mothers, and 27 siblings. You can further inspect age and sex distributions using `hist` and `table`.

```


# Data integration of methylation and glycomics

In this part, we consider a data integration approach to link the information in methylation and glycomics data. This 'joint information' is then related to Down syndrome. 

A flexible data integration approach for two heterogeneous datasets is O2PLS and is available in the OmicsPLS package. Recently, we've added a penalized version (group sparse O2PLS, GO2PLS) in OmicsPLS. We will also use GO2PLS to select the most important groups of methylation sites, the groups can be found in the `CpG_groups` object. Each CpG (methylation) site has one or more associated genes. The number of methylation sites is found by running `length(CpG_groups)`, and the number of groups is found with `length(unique(CpG_groups))`.

## Cross-validation

### Choosing the number of components 

To apply GO2PLS, we first need to decide on the number of components to retain. A cross-validation is usually performed. In the cross-validation, a grid is specified as well as the number of folds. If desired, you can use multiple cores to speed up the calculations. This is especially effective on a Linux or Mac. 

Note that there are other ways besides cross-validation, such as the scree plot ([click here for more info](https://selbouhaddani.eu/2020-10-11-Introduction-OmicsPLS-scree/)).

# par(mfrow=c(1,1))
# ## -> 3 5 1

r <- 2; rx <- 4; ry <- 6

```

### Choosing the number of methylation groups

After choosing the number of components, we need to specify how many methylation groups to select (a methylation group is a set of CpG sites that were grouped because the have the same target gene). Also here, a cross-validation is possible. There are many criteria to optimize in a cross-validation. We will go through some of them. 

The first one is the covariance between the joint components in the methylation and glycomics data, $\mathrm{Cov}(T,U)$ in the left out fold. This is implemented in the function `crossval_sparsity`. The advantage is that this criterion is independent of the case-control status and can be used in all kinds of study designs. On the other hand, the resulting number of groups to keep can be too small or large with respect to the number of groups that are relevant to the case-control status. 

:::: {.bluebox .question data-latex=""}
How many unique groups do we have? Use `length` and `unique` on `CpG_groups` for this.
Using the function `crossval_sparsity`, how many groups of CpG sites should we keep?

<div id="foo2" style="display:none">
There are 483 groups. Based on the CV, we should keep 200 groups in the first component, and 40 groups in the second. 
</div>
::::

\ 


```{r Decide number of groups, based on covariance, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(7545)
crossval_sparsity(methylation, glycomics, r,rx,ry, 10, 
                  groupx = CpG_groups, keepx_seq = 1:10*40, keepy_seq = 10)

```

To explicitly run a cross-validation that optimizes for predicting Down syndrome, we need to write a piece of code ourselves. We divide the subjects in each outcome class in ten folds, such that each fold consists of around three DS cases, three siblings and three mothers. We further define a grid of ten values for the number of groups to keep, from 1 to 483. 

```{r Decide number of groups, based on predicting outcome, cache = TRUE}
cv_folds <- 10 # number of folds
cv_cores <- 1 # number of cores
cv_intervals <- 10 # a grid with keepx values (groups to keep)
cv_set <- c(DS=cut(1:29, cv_folds) %>% as.numeric, # define folds in each outcome class
              SB=cut(1:27, cv_folds) %>% as.numeric, 
              MA=cut(1:29, cv_folds) %>% as.numeric)
X <- methylation
Y <- glycomics
group <- ClinicalVars$group_ds
cv_grid <- round(seq(1,length(unique(CpG_groups)),length.out=cv_intervals))

cvoutp <- mclapply(mc.cores=cv_cores,cv_grid, # compute errors across the grid, over the folds
function(jj){
  jj <- as.numeric(jj)
  cat(jj, "/", length(unique(CpG_groups)), "; ",sep="")
  outp <- sapply(1:cv_folds, function(ii){
    iii <- which(ii == cv_set)
    Xtst <- X[iii,]
    Ytst <- Y[iii,]
    Xtrn <- X[-iii,]
    Ytrn <- Y[-iii,]
    fit <- try(suppressMessages(o2m(Xtrn,Ytrn,r,rx,ry,sparse=T,keepx=jj,groupx = CpG_groups)), silent = TRUE)
    if(inherits(fit, "try-error")) fit <- suppressMessages(o2m(Xtrn,Ytrn,r,rx,ry,sparse=T,keepx=jj-1,groupx = CpG_groups))
    err1 <- mse(Y,predict(fit, X))/sqrt(ssq(Y))
    err2 <- mse(X,predict(fit, Y, "Y"))/sqrt(ssq(X))
    fit_outc <- lda(x=fit$Tt,group[-iii])
    err3 <- mse(as.numeric(group[iii])-1, 
                as.numeric(predict(
                  fit_outc,(Xtst-Xtst%*%fit$W_Y%*%t(fit$P_Y))%*%fit$W.)$class
                )-1)/sqrt(ssq(as.numeric(group[iii])-1))
    c(nr = jj, Yhat = err1, Xhat = err2, outc = err3)
  })
  outp
})
names(cvoutp) <- as.character(cv_grid)

```

An interactive plot is shown with three error types. The error when predicting $Y$ with $X$, $X$ with $Y$, and the outcome with $T$.

We redo the cross-validation for a finer grid around potential choices for the sparsity level. This should allow us to choose the definitive number of genes to retain. 

```{r Redo CV number of groups around certain values, cache = TRUE}
cv_gridbest <- round(c(25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 175, 200))
cvoutp_best <- mclapply(mc.cores = cv_cores, cv_gridbest, 
function(jj){
  jj <- as.numeric(jj)
  cat(jj,";  ")
  outp <- sapply(1:cv_folds, function(ii){
    iii <- which(ii == cv_set)

    if(inherits(fit, "try-error")) fit <- suppressMessages(o2m(Xtrn,Ytrn,r,rx,ry,sparse=T,keepx=jj-1,groupx = CpG_groups))
    err1 <- mse(Y,predict(fit, X))/sqrt(ssq(Y))
    err2 <- mse(X,predict(fit, Y, "Y"))/sqrt(ssq(X))
    fit_outc <- lda(x=fit$Tt,group[-iii])
    err3 <- mse(as.numeric(group[iii])-1, 
                as.numeric(predict(

    c(nr = jj, Yhat = err1, Xhat = err2, outc = err3)
  })
  outp
}); 
names(cvoutp_best) <- as.character(cv_gridbest)

```

We plot the error for each choice, using boxplots. In this way, the variation across cross-validation runs is shown.

## Apply GO2PLS to methylation and glycomics

### Fit GO2PLS

Based on the error of the outcome, it seems that 175 groups are optimal. We fit GO2PLS to the methylation and glycomics data, and calculate the variance explained by de joint and specific parts. 

```{r Fit GO2PLS and summary}
fit <- o2m(methylation, glycomics, r, rx, ry, sparse = TRUE, 
           groupx = CpG_groups, keepx = 175)
summary(fit)

```

### Visualize the results: loadings

Next, we inspect the loadings. Each label is a glycan or group name, and the axes represent the respective components. 

:::: {.bluebox .question data-latex=""}
Give an interpretation of these results. Which features have highest loadings, in which components? Are these features modeled to be correlated with one another?

For the glycan data: in component 1, P7 has a high loading value. In component 2, P1 and P4 are relatively high. For the methylation data: CpG sites grouped in the RCAN1 and RUNX1 genes have high loading values in components 1 and 2, respectively. 
</div>
::::

\ 


```{r Plot the loadings}
plot(fit,loading_name = "Yj",i=1,j=2,label = "col")
plot(fit,loading_name = "gr_Xj",i=1,j=2,label = "col", alpha = (apply(fit$W_gr,1,prod) > 0))
```


### Visualize the results: scores

Next, we investigate if these joint components are associated with Down syndrome. We first look at the scatterplot of the scores, colored by DS. 

:::: {.bluebox .question data-latex=""}

```{r Plot the scores}
plot(data.frame(Tt=fit$Tt,U=fit$U), col = ClinicalVars$group_ds)
data.frame(Group = ClinicalVars$group, JPC = scores(fit, "Xjoint")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-Group,
               names_to = "Comp", 
               values_to = "LoadingValue") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Comp, y=LoadingValue, col=Group)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_bw()
```

We perform a logistic regression with the Down syndrome status as outcome, and the joint methylation scores as covariates. 

:::: {.bluebox .question data-latex=""}

## Interpretation of the selected CpG groups

We saw that joint methylation component two seemed to be significantly associated with Down syndrome. Of interest is the groups that are selected, are their target genes representing some biological pathway? To this end, we use String-DB to cluster the selected groups/genes. Although there is an R package for String-DB, we are going to use [the String-DB website](https://string-db.org/). On the website, click "multiple proteins". The input there is the list of selected genes. 

```{r Interpretation based on selected genes}
gene_list <- row.names(loadings(fit, loading_name = "gr_Xj", subset = 2))
gene_list %<>% paste0(collapse = ";") %>% 
  str_split(";") %>% unlist %>% unique 

```

### Using string-DB

Copy-paste the selected genes in the String-DB website. 

:::: {.bluebox .question data-latex=""}
